# School mapping
## Comparison of offical school geolocations and locations obtained from Google Maps

Here are a few useful programs in R enabling collecting, checking, comparing and correcting geolocations of schools. Provided data sheets (CSV files) are just a sample of a much bigger dataset for schools in Serbia. If you have school names and approximate location, Google maps can give you geolocation in the most of cases. 

Code should work with text data in any language. It worked with Serbian cyrillic.
Presented picture is an example of a map tile with locations obtained in four different ways. Locations are marked as circles of different color:
- red - official location
- cyan - Google Maps location based on address
- yellow - Google Maps location based on school name
- white - location from cadastre
